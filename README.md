# streamlit-geolocation
A geolocation module for streamlit


This is heavily inspired by this repository: https://github.com/aghasemi/streamlit_js_eval 
I am simplifying the scope to just getting the user's location and not evaluating arbitrary javascript, but I owe a lot to the original author.
