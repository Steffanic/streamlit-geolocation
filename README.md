# streamlit-geolocation
A geolocation button for streamlit

This uses the javascript method navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition to get the user's location. The response is a GeolocationCoordinates object.

This is heavily inspired by this repository: https://github.com/aghasemi/streamlit_js_eval 
I am simplifying the scope to just getting the user's location and not evaluating arbitrary javascript, but I owe a lot to the original author.
